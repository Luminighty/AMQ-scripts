Just to store the scripts I've made (in case I make more)

## Character Card Align
[Add this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luminighty/AMQ-scripts/main/amqCharCardAlign.user.js)
Change the character cards to where they used to be (a bit higher up)
```js
// You can use this value to change how high up the character card is
// 40 is really close to what it used to be
const moveAmount = 40;
```
